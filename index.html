                    <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                    <P>
                        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
                        lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
                        environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over
                        them.

                            <a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
                            a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="c1">var x;</span> 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our
                            variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="c1"> var x = 10;</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types
                            that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="c1">true</span> or <span class="c1">false;</span> null - <span class="c1">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="c1">42</span> or <span class="c1">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="c1">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>
                            Array - <span class="c1">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span class="c1">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on
                            values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
                            conditional statements: <span class="c1">if </span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="c1">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first
                            condition is false; <span class="c1">else </span>we execute this block of code;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
                            an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of
                            instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we
                            screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more
                            tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
                        </li>
